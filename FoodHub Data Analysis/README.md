# FoodHub Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the New York City food delivery market for **FoodHub**, a food aggregator company. By analyzing customer orders, restaurant performance, and delivery timings, I provided data-driven recommendations to improve business operations and customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Demand Analysis:** Identify the most popular cuisines and restaurants in NYC.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Analyze delivery times and preparation times to identify bottlenecks.
- **Revenue Strategy:** Propose promotional strategies and commission tier structures based on order volume.
- **Customer Experience:** Correlate ratings with delivery times to improve service quality.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Analysis Techniques:** Univariate and Bivariate Analysis, Statistical Summaries, Data Visualization.

## 📊 Key Insights & Business Recommendations
- **Top Performers:** A small number of restaurants (e.g., Shake Shack, The Halal Guys) drive a significant portion of the total revenue.
- **Weekend Surge:** Demand peaks significantly during weekends; I recommended increasing the delivery fleet during these windows.
- **Efficiency Bottlenecks:** Identified that high total delivery times are often driven by restaurant preparation time rather than transit time.
- **Promotion Strategy:** Recommended a 20% commission on orders costing >$20 and 15% on orders >$5 to maximize revenue without discouraging customers.
